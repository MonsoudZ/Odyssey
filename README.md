# Odyssey

Project Title: Odyssey

This is a blog app that will be used for people to connect with who love going on adventures. It could be hiking,fishing,exploring a new city, anything you love.  Within the app you will also be able to access the My Gear section to view all the gear being used tied to a certain post/trip

MVP
The Minimum Viable Product should be a well-planned, easily-communicated product, ensuring that the client's deliverable will be achievable and meet specifications within the time frame estimated.



Goals

. Creating a blog that looks beautiful and a little different, with the pictures being more drawn in over the text
. Make a My gear page related to post, to help get others who are not sure what to wear or carry ideas on how to accomplish that
. Create a nice login page that is inviting
